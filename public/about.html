<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Pranav Paul, currently pursuing my 2nd year B.Tech degree in the Computer Science Department at KTU University.
  I am passionate about web development and am actively working on several projects that leverage my skills in HTML, CSS, 
  and JavaScript. My goal is to expand my expertise and become a proficient full-stack developer.</p>

<p>I have a solid foundation in web development and am eager to learn and incorporate new technologies into my skill set.
  Some of my current projects involve creating responsive and user-friendly web applications, which have helped me understand 
  the intricacies of front-end development. I am committed to continuous learning and aim to master both front-end and back-end 
  technologies to become a versatile developer.</p>
 
<p>Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a strong passion for sports. I love playing cricket and football,
  and I enjoy unwinding by watching or playing PC games. These activities not only provide a great balance to my life but 
  also fuel my determination and goal-oriented mindset.</p>

<p>I am a highly motivated individual, always striving to achieve my goals and make meaningful contributions to my field.</p>
