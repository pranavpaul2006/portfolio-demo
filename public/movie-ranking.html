<h1>The Best Movies According to Pranav</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Aavesham</h3>
<p>It's a good mix of mass and comedy.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is an intense, complex story, but it's always coherent, imaginative, and entertaining. </p>

<h3>Green Mile</h3>
<p> Phenomenal characters, a gripping story, great emotional scenes, fantastic writing, a break neck pace that helps the movie go along, a very emotional ending, and a message that is very inspiring.</p>
